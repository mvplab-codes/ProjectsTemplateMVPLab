# Visualization Files

This directory contains all visual materials created for the project, organized into two subdirectories:

- **Papers**: Figures, charts, and graphs used in research papers. These visuals are designed to illustrate findings, support data analysis, and enhance the clarity of scientific communication.
- **Presentations**: Visuals prepared for slides, posters, or other presentation formats. These include simplified or annotated versions of figures for effective audience engagement.

By separating visuals into these subdirectories, this structure ensures that all graphical assets are easily accessible and appropriately tailored for their intended purpose.
