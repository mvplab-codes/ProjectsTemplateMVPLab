# Notebook Files

This directory contains interactive notebooks used for the project's analysis, experimentation, and visualization. To ensure accessibility and reproducibility, all notebooks should be uploaded in the following formats:

- **HTML**: For easy viewing in web browsers without the need for additional software.
- **.notebook**: The original interactive notebook file (e.g., `.ipynb` for Jupyter) for editing and execution.
- **PDF**: A static, portable document format for sharing and archiving.

Uploading notebooks in these formats ensures that all collaborators can access and review the content, regardless of their preferred tools or environment.
