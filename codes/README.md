# Code Files

This directory contains all the code used in the project, organized into the following types:

- **Notebooks**: Interactive notebooks (e.g., Jupyter, MATLAB Live Scripts) used for experimentation, visualization, and exploratory analysis. These provide a step-by-step view of the project's workflows and methodologies.
- **Scripts**: Standalone scripts for implementing key functionalities, such as data processing, model training, or evaluation. These scripts are typically modular and reusable across different parts of the project.

The code in this directory serves as the core of the project, enabling reproducibility and ease of collaboration for team members or contributors.
