# Raw Data

This subdirectory contains the original, unaltered data collected for the project. It serves as the foundation for all subsequent data processing and analysis. Key characteristics of the raw data include:

- **Integrity**: The data is stored exactly as collected, without any modifications, to ensure accuracy and reproducibility.
- **Traceability**: Raw data provides a baseline for validating the results and methods used in the project.
- **Diversity**: This may include various formats such as text files, spreadsheets, images, or experimental logs, depending on the nature of the project.

It is essential to maintain the raw data in its original state and avoid overwriting or altering it during the project's workflow.
