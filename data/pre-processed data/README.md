# Pre-Processed Data

This subdirectory contains data that has been cleaned, transformed, or otherwise prepared for analysis. Pre-processing ensures the data is in a suitable format for modeling, visualization, or other workflows. Key aspects of pre-processed data include:

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies.
- **Transformations**: Normalizing, scaling, or encoding data to meet the requirements of specific methods or models.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting or creating features from raw data to improve analytical performance.
- **Consistency**: Organized and formatted data ready for immediate use in analysis or experimentation.

This directory ensures a clear distinction between the original raw data and the refined data used in the project, enhancing reproducibility and workflow transparency.
