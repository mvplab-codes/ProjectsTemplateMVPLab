# Data Directory

This directory is dedicated to storing all data used in the project, organized into two subdirectories:

- **Raw Data**: The original, unaltered data collected for the project. This may include experimental results, survey responses, or data from external sources. Raw data should remain unchanged to ensure the integrity and reproducibility of the project.
- **Pre-Processed Data**: Data that has been cleaned, transformed, or otherwise prepared for analysis. This includes steps such as normalization, feature extraction, or removing missing values.

By separating raw and pre-processed data, this structure ensures clarity and traceability in the project's data pipeline, making it easier to revisit or validate data preparation steps.
